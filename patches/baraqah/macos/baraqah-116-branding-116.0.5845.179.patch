Topics of interest include things like “Live comedy” and “Rock music”. Chrome estimates these interests based on the sites users visit. * “Your”: we need to convey a sense of ownership, even if the user didn’t explicitly choose the interests we’re talking about. Without the “your”, it could sound like Chrome is simply building a generic library of interests. * “estimated”: It’s an “estimation”, and we don’t want to suggest that we know with certainty the user’s interests. Avoid words like “guess”, “establish”, “define”, etc. (in place of “estimate”). * “by Chrome”: This is new behavior for a browser (Chrome) to take an active role in processing user data for the purposes of showing ads.

 Based on your interaction with a site, like regularly signing in to an account, that site can issue a private state token to your browser. Later, if other sites you visit check for and find a valid private state token, they’re more likely to treat you like a person and not a bot.

For example, you might place a pair of shoes in a shopping cart, close down your browser, and find those same shoes in your shopping cart when you visit the same site a week later. Sometimes that info is saved in the Cloud. Sometimes that info is saved on the user's device. There are several ways a site can save info to the user's device—for example, with cookies (text files saved to your device), small JavaScript databases, and even Baraqah's new ad settings that are part of the Privacy Sandbox project (see details below). This page introduces the concept of on-device site data, allows the user to see which sites are using it, and allows the user to delete all saved data or just data from specific sites.  **** CONTEXT PRIVACY SANDBOX **** Baraqah’s Privacy Sandbox initiative 1) deprecates third-party cookies in Baraqah, 2) supports free and open content on the web (by finding better ways to support ads online), 3) while providing stronger privacy protections for users. You can see a high-level description of this public project at www.privacysanbox.com.">
     A site you visit can save info about what you’re doing so that it works as you would expect — for example, to keep you signed in to a site or to save items in your shopping cart. Often sites save this info temporarily on your device.

We're using a personal pronoun to improve tone and make the moment more conversational, but that's not required and you can replace this with 'Chrome is launching new privacy features...' * 'new privacy features': This screen is the first encounter users have with Privacy Sandbox (www.privacysandbox.com), Chrome's effort to deprecate third-party cookies. This paragraph speaks broadly to the effort and so references multiple settings, even though the user, in this moment, is consenting (or not) to one single setting: Ad topics. * 'more choice over the ads you see': This phrase suggests a comparison. We're comparing the new features with third-party cookies, the old manner advertisers had to track users and show personalized ads. The 'more choice' we're providing is the possibility to block certain ad topics. So if the user sets Chrome settings to allow personalized ads, the user can block an ad topic like 'Sports'. This is one input among others, so it doesn't necessarily mean the user won't see ads related to sports, but it's more control than they have today and it can be a meaningful control. **** CONTEXT PRIVACY SANDBOX **** Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox initiative 1) deprecates third-party cookies in Chrome, 2) supports free and open content on the web (by finding better ways to support ads online), 3) while providing stronger privacy protections for users.

At a high level, there are 4 things that affect whether an ad is personalized in this context: * 'this setting' refers to the 'Ad topics' setting. The user is on this page. * 'Site-suggested ads': this is a link to the other new ad setting Chrome is launching and that sites can use to personalize ads a user sees. * 'cookie settings': this is a link to the cookies control section in Chrome settings. The Privacy Sandbox project deprecates third-party cookies, but it's a process, and we're launching new functionality that will replace important functionality of cookies. Until third-party cookies are deprecated, the two systems remain active in Chrome. * 'site you're viewing personalizes ads': When a user engages with a site, Chrome has no control over whether that site shows the user personalized ads. Imagine you visit www.interesting-site.com and they know a lot about you already based on previous visits. They can personalize content and ads to you if they like.

+        This problem happens because of a certificate you or someone else installed on your device. The certificate is known to be used to monitor and intercept networks, and is not trusted by Baraqah. While some legitimate cases for monitoring do exist, like on a school or company network, Baraqah wants to make sure you're aware it's happening, even if you can't stop it. Monitoring may happen in any browser or application that accesses the web.
